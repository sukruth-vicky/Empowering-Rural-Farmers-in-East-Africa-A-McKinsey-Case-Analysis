This case study explores how McKinsey collaborated with governments and partners to enhance economic opportunities for rural farmers across East Africa. 
The initiative focused on improving agricultural productivity, supply chain efficiency, and market access.

Over 200,000 smallholder farmers were supported through digital platforms, training programs, and data-driven farming models. 
As a result, average farmer incomes increased by nearly 30%, while regional supply chain efficiency improved by around 40%.

The study highlights how strategic partnerships, data analytics, and innovative financing models can drive sustainable economic growth and social inclusion for rural communities.
